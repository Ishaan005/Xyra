# Xyra: Drop-in SaaS Infrastructure for AI Monetization

Xyra is a flexible, open-core platform designed to empower AI-driven companies to monetize their services effectively. It provides the necessary infrastructure to implement various pricing models, manage subscriptions, and track usage, allowing you to focus on building innovative AI solutions.

## Vision

Our vision is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-integrate monetization layer for the rapidly growing AI industry. We aim to support a wide range of AI applications, from large language models to specialized AI agents, by offering robust and scalable SaaS infrastructure.

## Key Features (Planned/Under Development)

*   **Flexible Pricing Models:** Implement pay-as-you-go, tiered subscriptions, per-transaction, outcome-based, and custom pricing.
*   **Usage Tracking & Analytics:** Monitor API calls, feature usage, and resource consumption in real-time.
*   **Subscription Management:** Handle user sign-ups, plan changes, billing cycles, and invoicing.
*   **Tenant Management:** Support for multi-tenant architectures.
*   **API Key Management:** Securely generate and manage API keys for your users.
*   **Developer Portal:** A customizable portal for your users to manage their subscriptions, view usage, and access API documentation.
*   **Integration Hooks:** Webhooks and APIs to integrate with your existing systems (CRM, accounting, etc.).
*   **Open-Core Model:** A robust free Community Edition with options for premium features and support in an Enterprise Edition.

## Open-Core Model

Xyra operates on an open-core model:

*   **Community Edition (CE):** The core Xyra platform will be open-source (MIT or Apache 2.0 License), providing essential features for monetization. This version is ideal for startups, individual developers, and those who prefer to self-host and customize the platform.
*   **Enterprise Edition (EE):** (Planned) Will offer advanced features, dedicated support, and hosting options for larger organizations with more complex needs. Features might include advanced analytics, enterprise-grade security features, SLA guarantees, and more.

We believe this model fosters community collaboration and innovation while providing a sustainable path for the project's growth and the development of more sophisticated features.
